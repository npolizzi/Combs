Combs: Convergent motifs for binding sites
-----------------------------------
.. note::
   Please note that a user-friedly, updated version of COMBS will be available here by November 15, 2020.  
   We had planned to release an updated version during the summer, but our efforts were delayed due to 
   the global COVID-19 pandemic.  The new release will include vdM databases, for which we have 
   developed a new metric to determine redundancy in the PDB.  Please stay tuned til then!

SYNOPSIS
+++++++++

Combs is an open-source Python package for interfacial protein design.  
Combs generates and uses van der Mers (vdMs) to analyze and design 
interaction motifs in proteins, in small-molecule-protein interfaces as 
well as larger protein-protein interfaces.
